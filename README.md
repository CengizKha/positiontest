# GildedRose test
 
The project is made in java and maven. "The java version is not important but have 8+ is good"

To be able to execute the code the first time and 'mvn clean install -DskipTests' is necessary.

No others specifique framework or setup is necessery.

I started with the principe that the batch was already set up and the project required only a simple update of the function.

Otherwise Setup a spring batch is a easy and good option.
